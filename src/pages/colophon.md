ecrosstexas.com has been my personal web space since I discovered blogging in 2001. Through the years it has housed various incarnations of my [blog](/blog/), [links](/links), [photos](/photos/), personal projects and whatever other random stuff that interests me. 

The current design launched in March of 2023.

The site is currently hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and is published using the [11ty](https://11ty.dev) static site generator.
