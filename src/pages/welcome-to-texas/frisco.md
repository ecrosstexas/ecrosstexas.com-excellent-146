Let's help you settle in to your new [Frisco](https://www.friscotexas.gov) home

## Electricity

The best source to shop the electricity market in Texas is the [PowerToChoose](https://powertochoose.org) site.

That said, as a satisfied customer of over 6 years, I can't recommend [Champion Energy](https://www.championenergyservices.com/Residential/Sign-Up/Special-Offers/Get-Connected?refer=EWALLACE10872 ) enough. Here's [a link that will give us both $50 if you sign up with them](https://www.championenergyservices.com/Residential/Sign-Up/Special-Offers/Get-Connected?refer=EWALLACE10872).
