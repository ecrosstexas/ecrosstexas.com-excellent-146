Will you consider joining me at [Mehr Reformed Ministries](https://mehrministries.org/) [Always Reformed, Always Reforming](https://mehrministries.org/2021plano/) conference?

>It is with great excitement that we invite you to the Always Reformed, Always Reforming conference and launch party–the first of many Mehr Reformed Ministry events. We would be honored for you to join us in celebrating the official launch of our ministry as we work together to extend the ideals of the Protestant Reformation to the Farsi-speaking church.
>
>Come hear from Mehr leadership and notable leaders in the reformed community as we explore several questions:
>
>What is the heritage of the Protestant Reformation in Iran?
>What does it mean to be Reformed in the context of the persecuted church in Iran?
>How can reformed theology and covenant theology help the Farsi-speaking believers?
>Registration is free thanks to our partners, and the first 200 registrants will receive three complimentary books: R.C. Sproul, A life (Stephen J. Nichols), Saved from What? (R.C. Sproul), and Holiness of God (R.C. Sproul, Farsi Edition).

The conference and launch party will be held Friday, September 17, 2021, 8:00 am – 4:00 pm. at 2001 W Plano Pkwy, Plano, TX 75075.
