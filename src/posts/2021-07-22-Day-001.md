Just a quick post to make my day complete as I begin this #100DaysOfCode challenge.

Today I was able to relaunch ecrosstexas.com with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev)!

I was able to:

- Customize a TEA-stack starter template
- Commit all changes to GitHub
- Deploy site to Netlify, overcoming an issue with PostCSS configuration
- Update DNS records
