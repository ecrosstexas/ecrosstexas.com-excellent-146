Wrapping up day 7 of the [#100DaysOfCode](/tags/100daysofcode/) challenge. Lots of cleaning up the [code base](https://github.com/ecrosstexas/ecrosstexas-tea-base).

I've added my first [redirects](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/) to my netlify.toml file.

I need to get busy finishing the work on webmentions.io and begin the process to get my notes to post to twitter [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) anyone?
