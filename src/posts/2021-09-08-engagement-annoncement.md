It is with great joy that Shannon and I share the news that Zachary Seider (parents John and Debbie) of Richardson, asked for our daughter Emma's hand in marriage late in the afternoon this past Sunday in College Station. This planned union will be capstone on the incredible experience that Emma has had at [Texas A&M](https://www.tamu.edu), in [RUF](https://ruf.org/ministry/texas-am-university/), and as part of the [Westminster Bryan](https://wpcbryan.org) family. We are excited to have Zach as part of our family and look forward to their future together!

Both Emma and Zach will graduate from Texas A&M in December. The couple is planning a summer 2022 wedding in North Texas.
