Raise you hand if you didn't have this on your bingo card.  [Plano ISD](https://pisd.edu/) [announces](https://www.pisd.edu/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=4&ModuleInstanceID=4433&ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=119382&PageID=1) that the high schools and senior high schools will be unified in "branding" i.e. colors, mascots, etc., starting next year.

Just the other day my son Will went to middle school wearing a Plano Wildcats sweatshirt and I wondered how many kids wear Wildcat colors here in middle school.

It makes sense in many ways. You already have some high school students competing in athletics with the senior high teams. I wonder if this will lead to greater integration in the coming years. How will this affect things like band and orchestra? Will certain classes be available to all students 9-12 only at certain campuses?
