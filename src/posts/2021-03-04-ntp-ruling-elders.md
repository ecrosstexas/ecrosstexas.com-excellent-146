Fellow Ruling Elders, I encourage you in the name of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, to consider your calling as an Elder in the [Presbyterian Church in America](https://pcanet.org) and serve the church in all her courts. The founding of the PCA owes much to the [involvement of Ruling Elders](https://www.theaquilareport.com/the-ruling-elder-teaching-elder-disparity-in-the-pca/) committed to the Word of God. To say the future of the PCA rests in the hands of REs today isn't an overstatement. Do you want a PCA firmly committed to the Word of God, the Westminster Standards, and the orthodox catholic faith once-and-for-all delivered to the saints? [Serve the church](https://www.theaquilareport.com/the-responsibility-of-ruling-elders-to-attend-the-courts-of-the-church/)!
