Day 6 is in the books.

I discovered that I didn't commit the changes to add webmentions links to the head back on [Day 004](/posts/day-004/). I also discovered a typo in my [sitemap.xml](/sitemap.xml) file that was causing the URL for every page to be <https://www.ecrosstexas.com/sitemap.xml>.

I added a number of old pages back to the site, although more than a few remain in draft status right now as I clean up the html and convert them to markdown.

Finally, I've started [my notes](/notes/) section. I look to have tweets start here in the future and have my history of tweets pulled into this site.
