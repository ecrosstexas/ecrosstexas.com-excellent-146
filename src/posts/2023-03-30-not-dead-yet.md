I wrote all that great sounding stuff back in 2021. Here I am still struggling to actually post something for public view, because I'm really crazy about how it looks. Then one day I saw the [Eleventy Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev) email saying [Lene Saile](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/) was going to talk about [organizing your Eleventy config.js](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/blog/organizing-the-eleventy-config-file/) file something I had been playing with months ago. Clicking on her name, what do I see, but she has built an [excellent starter kit](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) based on Andy Bell’s “be the browser’s mentor” workflow for [buildexcellentwebsit.es.](http://buildexcellentwebsit.es/) Andy's talk/site really resonated me when I first saw it nearly a year ago...right about the time I started doing everything else except working on this site.

Well that changes now.  I need to get this back rocking and rolling they way I've always hoped it could.  I've got plenty of content to share in half baked form.

I really need to take Steve Jobs' advice to heart.
