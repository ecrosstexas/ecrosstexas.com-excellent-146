Some work on the [`<head>`](https://htmlhead.dev) today thanks to the inspiration from [Manuel Matuzovic](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/)

In addition, more reorganizaiton of the code base. Thanks to @jeromecoupe and his post [Structuring Eleventy projects](https://www.webstoemp.com/blog/eleventy-projects-structure/) that inspired me to organize the `_11ty` folder.
