Day 4 of the #100DaysOfCode, had me continuing to work on the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) movement this time working with [Webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention). Not sure I have it working yet, but I'm calling it a day. Thanks to Sia.Codes for your excellent [tutorial](https://sia.codes/posts/webmentions-eleventy-in-depth/).
