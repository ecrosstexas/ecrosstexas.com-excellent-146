Enough goofing around I'm starting over with [Eleventy](http://11ty.dev/).  I've barely been blogging for years now.  I took my [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) site down almost 2 years ago after the site was compromised thanks to an insecure plugin I was running. I've had every intention of getting my site back up running again with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com). It's a great tool, but I don't really have the time to devote to developing and running a full-stack site in Django.

I've seen many sites built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com), and other [static site generators](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/). They always looked appealing and reminded me of the simplicity of [Movable Type](https://movabletype.org) which I used once upon a time in the past until it would bring my shared hosting site to a near standstill when rebuilding the site.  Somewhere along the line in the past year I discovered [Jamstack](https://github.com/automata/awesome-jamstack).

I watched several videos on YouTube covering Jamstack and started playing with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) since it seemed to be getting so much traction. Speed, security, and plugins galore. I know I'm a bit slow and I don't know a ton of JavaScript, but oh man it seems so complicated!  It drove me crazy that I couldn't easily inspect the code served up with the dev server.


As I kept looking into Jamstack, I eventually stumbled upon [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev). I believe I have found a home! This "simpler static site generator" is a thing of beauty.  I've played around with a couple of tutorials and then took the plunge and bought Andy Bell's awesome new tutorial [Learn Eleventy From Scratch](https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/).  I just can't seem to move forward without everything in place and everything complete. I want to believe in creating in public and iterative design, yet I sit on my hands and don't launch anything.

Well that changes today. ecrosstexas.com is going back online as a functional website and I am going to commit to a [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com) to get this site where I want it to be again. All my old content and blog posts will finally be coming back online.

Thank you to Shane Robinson for this [TEAstack](https://github.com/shanerobinson/tea-base-template) _(TailwindCSS, 11ty, Alpine.js)_ small site/blog template.

Come along with me and enjoy the ride. Buckle up, it might be bumpy!
