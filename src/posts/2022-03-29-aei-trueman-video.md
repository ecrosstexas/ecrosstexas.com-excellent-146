  Every society has some understanding of the nature and purpose of human life. What is the American definition of individualism, and how did it become dominant? What are its possibilities, and who are its discontents?

  Please join AEI’s Benjamin Storey and Jenna Silber Storey and Grove City College’s Carl R. Trueman, author of “Strange New World: How Thinkers and Activists Redefined Identity and Sparked the Sexual Revolution” (Crossway, 2022), for a conversation about America’s unique answers to these questions. Their discussion — moderated by the Ethics & Public Policy Center’s Ryan T. Anderson — will trace America’s “expressive individualism” back to the concept of the modern self and show that this understanding of human life has had profound implications for religious liberty, governance, and the education of our children.
