I highly encourage you to listen to this podcast. Darrell B. Harrison and Virgil Walker are spot on. The issue is the fall/sin and the only solution is changed hearts that come from the Gospel.

They have a lot more to say in other episodes, but these are the most relevant to recent discussions surrounding the death of George Floyd.
