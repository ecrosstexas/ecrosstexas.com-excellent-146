Ok, day 5 is coming to an end. Lots of small changes.

I also found Mike Street's [diary](https://www.mikestreety.co.uk/diary). I really like his format and I shamelessly borrowed it for my blog [archives](/blog/archives). Now I need to figure out if I can use the same code for multiple archive collections.
