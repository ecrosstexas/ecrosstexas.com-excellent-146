Emma sent us a text this morning with a Spotify link to the EP recorded last Spring in Houston at [Christ the King Presbyterian Church](https://www.christtheking.com) with students from [Texas A&M's RUF](https://ruf.org/ministry/texas-am-university/).  The EP features Haven Freeman with the vocals and Emma's ~~boyfriend~~ fiancé Zach Seider on the drums. Give it a listen!
