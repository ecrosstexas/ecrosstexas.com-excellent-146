- christianaudio [free audiobook](https://christianaudio.com/free/) is *Humility*.

- Logos [free book](https://www.logos.com/free-book-of-the-month) is *Recovering the Unity of the Bible*
    > In Recovering the Unity of the Bible, Walt Kaiser makes the case for the unity of the Bible. The theological unity of the Bible celebrates the diversity of the Bible—but does so with the conviction that even though that unity can be tested historically, ethically, and otherwise, it has not detracted from the central case for the theological harmony that is found in the text. This has been the general conclusion of two millennia of Judo-Christian exegesis.

- Reformation Heritage Books [free book](https://mailchi.mp/heritagebooks/09fv3j7d6q) is *All That is in God*.
    > Unknown to many, increasing numbers of conservative evangelicals are denying basic tenets of classical Christian teaching about God, with departures occurring even among those of the Calvinistic persuasion. James E. Dolezal’s All That Is in God provides an exposition of the historic Christian position while engaging with these contemporary deviations. His convincing critique of the newer position he styles “theistic mutualism” is philosophically robust, systematically nuanced, and biblically based. It demonstrates the need to maintain the traditional viewpoint, particularly on divine simplicity, and spotlights the unfortunate implications for other important Christian doctrines—such as divine eternality and the Trinity—if it were to be abandoned. Arguing carefully and cogently that “all that is in God is God Himself,” the work is sure to stimulate debate on the issue in years to come. 

- H&E Publishing [free book](https://hesedandemet.com/free/) is *Defending Jesus' Crucifixion against Islamic Revision*
    > The truth of Jesus' crucifixion, one of the most verifiable events in history, has been challenged by Muslims since the creation of Islam and the writing of the Qur'an. Muslims believe there was a crucifixion, but the majority deny that it was Jesus who was the one crucified. 

- Crossway [free book](https://mailchi.mp/crossway/free-ebook-awe) is *Awe: Why It Matters for Everything We Think, Say, and Do*.
    > Our hearts are always captured by something—that’s how God made us. But sin threatens to distract us from the glory of our Creator. All too often, we stand in awe of everything but God.
    >
    > Uncovering the lies we believe about all the earthly things that promise us peace, life, and contentment, Paul Tripp redirects our gaze to God’s awe-inducing glory—showing how such a vision has the potential to impact our every thought, word, and deed.
