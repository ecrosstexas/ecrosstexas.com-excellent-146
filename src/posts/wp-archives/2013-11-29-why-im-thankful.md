Another Thanksgiving Day is nearly done. I'd be remiss if I didn't stop and say thanks for a few things.

- Dallas Stars, Texas A&M Football, Texas Rangers, and yes, even the Dallas Cowboys.

- Twitter, Django, Netflix, Apple TV, MacBooks, iPhones.

- Mark Levin, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Edward Snowden, and many more who are trying to reform our country. We need to get back to the constitutional republic that the Founding Fathers gave us.

- Hard Hitters: A wonderful group of girls (and their families) that are a joy to coach.

- In-Laws: Extremely generous and supportive. I can't begin to say thanks for all the help they provide with the kids.

- Parents: Generous to a fault. They would do anything for me and my family.

- Teazzers: My bosses, co-workers, customers, and suppliers which allow me to earn a living and provide for my family.

- Trinity Presbyterian Church: I am so thankful that my family hears, sings, prays, speaks the Gospel while sitting under the teaching of faithful ministers. I'm also thankful for the friendships we've made.

- My three children: Emma, Molly, and William who are a never ending source of joy.

- My fabulous wife Shannon: I wouldn't want to do this with anyone else by my side.

- Jesus Christ: His substitutionary, atoning sacrifice on the cross and His resurrection for my justification. I am so undeserving of the love of the great triune God.
