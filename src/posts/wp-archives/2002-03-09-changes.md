You might have noticed that ecrosstexas.com has been getting a bit stale of late. I have been very busy at home and work (more on that later). I have been wanting to make a move to [b2](http://cafelog.com) for some time, but I kept putting it off. b2 isn't perfect yet, but it is getting there.

Well no more. Here it is! Not everylink in the header menu or side bar works yet, but they will soon. b2 looks to be a big improvement for ecrosstexas.com. If you prefer the phpWebSite version it will temporarily remain available at http://ecrosstexas.com/old/.
