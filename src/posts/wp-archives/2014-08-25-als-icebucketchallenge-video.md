Yes, we are a little slow, but we accepted the multiple Ice Bucket Challenges from [Beckett and Jaxon Robertson](https://www.facebook.com/korie.robertson), [Brooke Serpas Lee](https://www.facebook.com/brooke.serpas) and [Brittany Serpas](https://www.facebook.com/brittany.serpas), and [Dayne Masters](https://www.facebook.com/dayne.masters). We don't check Facebook all that often, so apologies for the delay and last week was pretty crazy getting ready for back to school.

We love Uncle Ken Serpas and pray for God's mercy in his battle with ALS.

We have issued our own challenge to [John Sharber](https://www.facebook.com/john.sharber.94) and [Ami Gunter](https://www.facebook.com/ami.gunter).
