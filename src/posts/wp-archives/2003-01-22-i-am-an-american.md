> I am endowed by my Creator
> with the unalienable right to life.
> Just like you, and every other American.
> You know who I am.
> Now that you can see my face,
> will you use your voice?
> Please tell America,
> I am an American, too.

> 30 years of denying this self-evident truth is long enough.
> America, it's time to protect your children again.
