Reformation Day is a celebration of God's saving work. It is the recovery of the great truths of Scripture: Justification (being made right with God) by Faith alone, by Grace alone, through Christ alone, for the Glory of God alone. And our highest and final authority is Scripture alone.

## A New 95

Lastly, Chris Rosebrough has posted [A New 95 Theses: Challenging The Excesses Of American Evangelicalism](http://www.fightingforthefaith.com/a-new-95-theses-challenging-the-excesses-of-american-evangelicalism.html) that everyone should read:

> Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, the public bulletin board of his day. In like manner, we post these 95 theses on the door of the internet. Like the original theses, these are debatable, for we believe that it is through vigorous debate that the spirits are tested and truth is revealed.
>
> In publishing these theses, we do not intend to foment division, but to expose those who are creating division within the body of Christ. We invite all who love the Gospel of Jesus Christ to engage in this debate. We do so in the spirit of the great Reformer, Martin Luther, as we implore the mercies of God upon His Church, for the sake of Jesus Christ, the Lord of the Church and shepherd of our souls.
